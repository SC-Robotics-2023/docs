## Don’t be dumb, be smart, be safe
* Don’t eat or drink near electronics
    * That being said don’t leave opened drinks on a table with electrical things
* Wear close shoes with rubber soles
    * You are a conductor
    * Prevents you from being grounded (complete a circuit between component and ground)
    * Technically you should also wear closed shoes since you are in a lab
* Isolate all exposed metals in the rover!! No buts!
* Don’t work with wet hands
* Check conditions prior to interaction
* Ask/google if you are unsure
* Don’t be lazy
* __USE COMMON SENSE__

### Short Circuits
* Positive side of battery is “shorted” (connected) to negative side
* Battery will draw a huge amount of current because the potential difference will be 0
* Sparks at connection point 
* Can damage battery
* You can also short circuit other components by shorting the leads, so please don’t
* Don’t use duct tape inside rover, it is conductive 

### Tools 101
* Don’t touch the hot end of the soldering iron
* __Wash your hands after soldering__ - lead is toxic
* Unplug equipment when not in use 

### Batteries 101
* Don’t leave batteries charging overnight
* Don’t overcharge battery either

### Cable Management and Convention
* Zip-ties/Cable-ties
    * zips that tie and ties that zip
    * Don’t cut at an angle. It leaves sharp ends
* Always try to follow convention 
    * Avoids confusion with other people 
    * e.g. black wire = ground wire, red wire = power (positive) wire
* Cable sleeving is good to bundle wires together
* Cable shielding is good to reduce external noises
* Printed Circuit Boards is plus ultra to reduce jumper wires on circuits 
* Make an electrical Block Diagram
* Plan electrical layout with Mechanical System
    * Use SolidWorks to approximate sizing
