### Common Tools
* Wire cutter (flush cutter)

* Wire stripper

    * AWG = American Wire Gauge
    * Smaller number = bigger wire

   

* Ratcheting Crimper (Anderson, Dupont, and general)

    * Build those arm muscles ðŸ’ª

* Soldering Iron

    * Join two components (usually wires) together
    * Good tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qps9woUGkv
    * Use heat shrink tubing to insulate exposed conductor

* Heat Gun

    * Hot hair dryer to shrink heat shrink tubing

* Flathead screwdriver 
    * Always missing when you most need it

### Multimeter 101

![Multimeter](./img/Multimeter.png)

* Measure Current, Voltage, Resistance, Continuity in AC and DC
* Make sure that you got the correct ports! 
* Make sure you have DC selected!
* COM and V ohm port
    * This configuration makes it so that the DMM has infinite resistance so current only flows through the branch of what is being measured
    * Measure branch in _parallel_
    * __Continuity:__ Checks for the presence of a complete path for current to flow
    * __Voltmeter:__ measures voltage
    * __Ohmmeter:__ measure resistance
* COM and A port
    * This configuration makes it so that the DMM has ideally no resistance so current flows through the ammeter to measure the branchâ€™s current
    * Measure branch in _series_
    * __Ammeter:__ measures current

### Connectors
* Anderson connector

* XT90/XT60 connector

* Wago connector

    * Good for when there is no time to solder, but it is not a replacement for soldering
    * Good for quick testing
