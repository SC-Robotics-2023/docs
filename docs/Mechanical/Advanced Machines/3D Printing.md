## Tolerances
3D Prints are basically melted plastic, so when designing, you need to consider that the plastic will shrink a little bit and add some tolerance.

For clearance holes, to avoid having to drill out the hole, follow this guideline:
* For #10 clearance holes and smaller, the holes should be "Loose" clearance in SolidWorks. 
* For 1/4" clearance holes and larger, they should be "Normal" clearance in SolidWorks.
