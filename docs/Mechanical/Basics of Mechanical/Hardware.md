# Hardware (BIG WIP)
Everything you wanted to know about the hardware on the rover!

## Materials

## Fasteners
### Bolts
> Bolts are fasteners with externally threaded shafts. Bolts we use are typically tightened with a hexagonally-shaped key. 

There are several important characteristics of bolts, including the system of measurement, naming, and head type.
* Metric vs Imperial: metric bolts use mm for dimensions, while imperial bolts use in for dimensions.
* Bolt sizing
    * Metric: `nominal diameter`-`pitch` x `length`.
        * e.g. M4-0.7 x 12 is a bolt with a 4mm diameter, 0.7mm between threads, and 12mm of length.
    * Imperial: `major diameter`-`threads per inch` x `length`
        * e.g. 1/4-20 x 1/2" is a bolt with 1/4" diameter, 20 threads per inch, and 1/2" of length.
* Socket Head, Button Head, Flat Head (aka CounterSunk)
    * Button Head: Used for standard load applications. Most common.
    * Socket Head: Used for high load applications. Taller head and bigger hex size allows for more torque to be applied when tightening, but requires more clearance.
    * Flat Head (CounterSunk): Used when little clearance is available for a head. Requires countersink drill bit.
* Loctite
    * Loctite threadlocker is a liquid or gluestick that you rub on the threads of the bolt before fastening onto a tapped hole (not on nuts). It then expands and solidifies to fill the gap between the threads, friction-locking the bolt in place.
    * You should always use loctite on final assembly because screws can loosen and fall out due to vibration.
    * When adding loctite, check if there is already old loctite (white crust) on the bolt. If so, clean off the bolt before reapplying to ensure the new loctite has clean threads to tighten.
    * In almost all cases, blue loctite is good enough (there are stronger versions like red that make the bolt very difficult to remove)
    * __NOTE:__ Do not use loctite for any bolt that fastens through plastic--the fumes released may crack/weaken the plastic. Use super glue instead if necessary.

### Nuts
> Nuts are fastening elements used in conjunction with screws.

There are many different types of nuts for different applications. Some of these are listed:
* Hex Nuts: general purpose nut
* Lock Nuts: a nylon insert compresses when the bolt is fastened, "locking" the nut in place
* Flange Nuts: a flange distributes pressure, so you don't need a washer
* Thumb Screws: wings allow tightening and loosening by hand

### Rivets
> Rivets are permanent fasteners that work by squeezing two items teogether by forcefully crushing metal. They are used when you can only access one side of the material, and are very easy to use with the right tools.

There are several important parts of a rivet:

* Rivet pin: important features are diameter and grip length. Grip length determines how thick the material that you are fastening together can be.
* Head: the head can be dome-headed (similar to button-headed bolts) or flush-headed (similar to flat-headed bolts)
* Mandrel: there are different mandrel diameters for different strengths of rivets, and they need a specific attachment on the riveting tool

Rivets can be "drilled out" and replaced using a drill bit that corresponds to the diameter of the rivet pin

### Washers
> Washers are used to distribute the load of tightening a bolt over a wider area, allowing the bolt to be more strongly tightened without damage to the surface. Especially important for plastic.

### Retaining Rings
> Retaining rings are a low-profile solution put on the end of a shaft to stop the shaft from falling out the other way.

There are two main kinds of retaining rings: snap rings and e-clips

### Shaft Collars
> 

## Gears
> Gears are one of the most basic pieces of rotary transmission hardware. They are used to swap rotation direction and in gearboxes for reducing speed/increasing torque.

## Bearings and Bushings
> Bearings are used wherever there is rotary transmission. They minimize the friction of a rotating shaft to maximize efficiency.

There are several different kinds of bearings:
* Flanged vs Radial
* Shielded vs Unshielded
* Dynamic and Static Thrust Capacity
