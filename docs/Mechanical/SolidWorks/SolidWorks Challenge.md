If you're here, you should have read the [SolidWorks Basics](./Solidworks%20Basics.md)

Here's the challenge: CAD each of these drawings in SolidWorks (maybe one a day)--it will give you familiarity with the software and the part environment.
As you design, follow this flowchart to understand the proper process to design any part:

[Day0](./Challenge/day0%20shooter_motor_support.pdf)

[Day1](./Challenge/day1%20elevator_top_connector.pdf)

[Day2](./Challenge/day2%20intake_finger.PDF)

[Day3](./Challenge/day3%20hp_grabber.pdf)

[Day4](./Challenge/day4%20magazine_side_plate.PDF)

[Day5](./Challenge/day5%20fancy_chunk.pdf)

[Day6](./Challenge/day6.zip)

[Day7](./Challenge/day7%203_pneumatic_tank_holder.pdf)

Then, send your completed file to a more experienced member who can offer in-depth suggestions on how to improve the method of design.
