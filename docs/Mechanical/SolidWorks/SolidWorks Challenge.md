If you're here, you should have read the [SolidWorks Basics](./Solidworks%20Basics.md)

Here's the challenge: CAD each of these drawings in SolidWorks (maybe one a day)--it will give you familiarity with the software and the part environment.
As you design, follow this flowchart to understand the proper process to design any part:

[Day1](./Challenge/day1%20elevator_top_connector.pdf)

[Day2](./Challenge/day2%20intake_finger.PDF)

[Day3](./Challenge/day3%20hp_grabber.pdf)

[Day4](./Challenge/day4%20magazine_side_plate.PDF)

[Day5](./Challenge/day5%20fancy_chunk.pdf)

[Day6](./Challenge/day6.zip)

[Day7](./Challenge/day7%203_pneumatic_tank_holder.pdf)

Then, compare your files with these solution files to see how you could have done it better (redesigning it from scratch without looking is a plus). Of course, there is more than one way to design a part, and oftentimes there's no such thing as a "better" design. BUT if you're a beginner, you'll have something to learn:


Okay, now you're best friends with SolidWorks!!! (actually it should be a love-hate relationship if anything) Now, you'll get to use your own creativity to design your own mechanism, and that's where the fun begins! [SolidWorks Project](./Solidworks%20Project-Gearbox.md)
