## Introduction

By now, you should have complete the SolidWorks Basics training and the SolidWorks Challenge--congrats! This means you know how to use the software and make basic parts! Now, you'll get to the more fun part of designing--creativity. In this final project, you'll learn how to take an idea (gearbox) through layout sketching, modeling, assembly, and pocketing. There won't be any drawings to follow, so you can design it however you'd like, with a few constraints.

## Step 1: What's a gearbox? :gear:

## Step 2: Layout sketch, layout sketch, layout sketch :pencil:
