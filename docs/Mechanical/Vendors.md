# Vendors (where to get the goods)
[McMaster](https://www.mcmaster.com/) - Great quality and shipping time for all kinds of hardware, but they tend to overprice things so double check your alternatives.  
[Industrial Metal Supply](https://www.industrialmetalsupply.com/) - Great place to get sheet metal and tube stock.  
[Servocity](https://www.servocity.com/) - Good for basic robotic mechanisms like gears, lead screws, etc. The quality and prices aren't amazing but they are consistent and have a lot of options.  
[Grainger](https://www.grainger.com/) - Similar to McMaster but not as commonly used. Basically use it when you can't find something on McMaster or it's too expensive lol  
[Amazon](https://amazon.com/) - Always good for shipping times and miscellaneous components--probably from a random vendor so quality isn't guaranteed.  
[VEX Pro](https://www.vexrobotics.com/pro) - FRC supplier. Has a lot of common components like shafts, sprockets, gears, etc. and the userbase is huge (cause FRC).  
[West Coast Products](https://wcproducts.com/) - Very similar to VEX Pro but different vendor
