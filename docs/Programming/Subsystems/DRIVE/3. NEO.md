# NEO Motors
NEO is a line of brushless electric motors developed by REV Robotics for use in robotics and other applications. These motors are designed to be high-performance and efficient, with a focus on providing smooth and precise control.

Some of the key features of NEO motors include:

- High torque density: NEO motors have a high power-to-weight ratio, allowing them to deliver high torque output for their size and weight.

- Low cogging: NEO motors have low levels of cogging torque, which can cause jerky or uneven movement in other motors. This makes them well-suited for applications that require smooth and precise movement.

- Integrated encoder: NEO motors come with an integrated encoder that provides feedback on the motor's position and speed. This allows for precise control of the motor's movement and can be used for closed-loop control.

- Flexible mounting: NEO motors can be mounted in a variety of orientations, making them versatile for use in different applications.

- Low heat generation: NEO motors are designed to generate less heat than other motors of similar power, which can help to prolong the life of the motor and reduce the need for additional cooling.

Overall, NEO motors are well-suited for use in robotics applications that require precise and efficient motor control. They can be used in a variety of applications, including robotic arms, drones, and other mobile robots.
